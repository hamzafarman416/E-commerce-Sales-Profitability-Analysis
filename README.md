# E-commerce-Sales-Profitability-Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset containing 1,000+ transactions. By leveraging SQL for data management and Power BI for visualization, I transformed raw data into actionable business insights regarding regional performance, product profitability, and the impact of discounts.
Tech Stack
Data Cleaning: Microsoft Excel (Power Query)

Database Management: MySQL

Data Visualization: Power BI

Documentation: Markdown

📂 Project Structure
Cleaned_E-commerce_Store_Data_Final.xlsx: The source data after cleaning and formatting.

ecommerce_store_analytics_queries.sql: SQL scripts for database creation and complex analytical queries.

E-commerce_sales_dashboard.pbix: The interactive Power BI dashboard file.

Analysis_CSVs/: Exported reports on Seasonality, Discount Impact, and Category Trends.

📊 Key Business Insights
Through this analysis, I identified several critical patterns:

Regional Growth: The UK and Canada are the most profitable regions, despite the USA having high transaction volume.

Product Performance: The Beauty category leads in total profit, while Clothing moves the highest number of units but with lower margins.

Discount Strategy: Data analysis shows that while a 15% discount maximizes sales volume, it leads to a sharp decline in average profit per unit.

Seasonality: Sales peak significantly in June and August, suggesting a need for higher inventory levels during the summer months.

🚀 How to Use This Project
Database: Import the .sql file into your MySQL Workbench to recreate the database and run the analytical queries.

Power BI: Open the .pbix file to explore the interactive dashboard. (Note: You may need to update the data source settings to point to the local Excel file).
